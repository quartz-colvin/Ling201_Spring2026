# Non-standard rules (*a*-prefixing)

.pull-left[
- Even though *a*-prefixing is non-standard, it follows rules!

- You can use a-prefixing:

  - Before *-ing* **verbs** but not **adjs** or **nouns**

  - Before a **consonant** but not a vowel

- **Non-standard varieties follow their own rules.**

- **These rules are part of speakers’ mental grammar.**
