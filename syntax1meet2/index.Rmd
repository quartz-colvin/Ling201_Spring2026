# Review 


**Parts of speech** are categories of words that tend to behave in similar ways:

- noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, preposition, conjunction

--

We already have clear intuitions about what nouns, verbs, and adjectives are, but...

--

- **Adverbs** modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs

--

- **Determiners** help specify a word's **reference** (what actual thing in the world a word refers to)

--

- **Prepositions** indicate some relationship between a noun and the other words in a sentence

--

- **Conjunctions** join together two words, phrases, or clauses

--

We can figure them out based on context, by considering their:

- **morphological distribution** – what kinds of morphemes they have.

- **syntactic distribution** – where they tend to appear in the sentence.

--

And this will be fundamental to our understanding of **syntax**, as we start putting words together to form **sentences**.

--

The first step of building sentences from individual words brings us to **constituency**, the topic of today!

# Constituents 

## What is a constituent? 

.pull-left[

- ***A group of words that acts together as a unit***

- a basic structure in syntax


Some examples

- **Justin** teaches linguistics.

- **My cat** likes rice. 

  - *(this is true)*

- **That tall guy from NJ** likes philosophy.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="50%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/gible.jpg")
```

]

--

Even though the bold constituents can have only one word or several, they act as a unit to describe a single concept.

---

# Constituents: phrases (types)

**Phrases** are types of constituents 

--

Each phrase has a main word (or **head**), and phrases are named after the head word's part of speech.

- remember how we drew trees for *blackberry*? 

- **headedness** applies to bigger constituents too!

  - headedness is a property of language and its relevant wherever we can discuss structure in language

---

# Constituents: phrases

- Noun phrase (NP)
  
  - *woman, the woman, the happy woman, the woman with the hat*

--

- Prepositional phrase (PP)

  - *into the forest, by the author, for good luck*

--

- Verb phrase (VP)

  - *eats, eats pizza, eats quickly, eats pizza quickly at midnight*

--

- Adjective phrase (AdjP)

  - *happy*

--

- Adverb phrase (AdvP)

  - *quickly, very quickly*

**Note that one constituent may contain another, smaller constituent.**

# Constituency tests!

# Constituency tests 

We can do tests to determine whether a group of words form a constituent or not.

These are the four tests we'll use:

--

1. replacement/substitution 

2. stand-alone

3. movement 

4. coordination 

**As is usually the case, these tests don't always work 100% of the time, so you should try multiple!!!**

---

# Constituency tests 

Consider the following sentence ([the happy student] and [in New Brunswick] are constituents)

- [The happy student] lives [in New Brunswick]

This is the example sentence which we will perform constituency tests for.

---

# Constituency tests

## Replacement


**Replacement test:** try replacing a group of words with a *pro-form* (a pronoun or another generic expression such as *there, like that, do, do that, that way*).

If it works, or still sounds grammatical, then the words are a constituent.

--

- [The happy student] lives in New Brunswick → [She] lives in New Brunswick
  
  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent!

--

- The happy student [lives in New] Brunswick → The happy student [??] Brunswick

  - this **doesn't** work, so [lives in New] is not a constituent 


---

# Constituency tests 

## Stand alone

**Stand alone test:** try coming up with a question that can be answered by just saying the group of words you want to test on its own

- Who lives in New Brunswick? [The happy student]!

  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent


---

# Constituency tests  

## Movement 

**Movement test:** try moving a group of words to a different part of the sentence, like the beginning or end of the sentence. You *may* need to add extra words to support this movement.

- The person who lives in New Brunswick is [the happy student].

  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent
  
- Student who lives in New Brunswick is [the happy]

  - this doesn't work, so [the happy] is not a constituent


---

# Constituency tests 

## Coordination 

**Coordination test:** coordinating conjunctions like *and* or *or* will always join two words or phrases of the same type. So, if a group of words is a constituent, you should be able to insert another phrase of the same type joined with *and* or *or*

- [The happy student] and [the grumpy professor] live in New Brunswick.

  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent

# Practice

(Worksheet can be downloaded [here!](constituency-tests-worksheet.pdf))

.pull-left[

**The happy student lives in New Brunswick.**

- is "in New Brunswick" a constituent?

- is "the happy" a constituent?

- is "student lives" a constituent?


**The tragedy upset the entire family.**

- is "the tragedy" a constituent?


**They hid in the cave.**

- is "in the cave" a constituent?

**The computer was very expensive.**

- is "computer was very" a constituent?


**The geese swam across the lake.**

- is "swam across" a constituent?

]


.pull-right[

**Mary gave a book to her sister.**

- is "a book to her sister" a constituent?

**Linda read a book about geology.**

- is "a book about geology" a constituent?

]

# Summary

# Summary 

We have four main constituency tests we'll use for this class:

- replacement/substitution

- stand-alone

- movement

- coordination

These tests don't always work 100% of the time, so you should try multiple!!!

--

Building constituents is the first step to building full sentences, which we will start doing next week, with our familiar tree structures!
