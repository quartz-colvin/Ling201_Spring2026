# This week...

- So far we've learned what a morpheme is.

- And we've learned about different types of morphemes:

  - root vs. affix, free vs. bound, inflectional vs. derivational

- Today we're going to learn how to put morphemes together to make new words:

  - Morphological Processes

- But first, I want to clarify a points that can be tricky when breaking down words.

---

# Tricky morphemes

Consider the word *break-able*. Which description best fits this word?

- A compound word with two roots: *break + able*

- A simple word with the root break and the suffix -able

We know able is a separate word. But do the word *able* and *-able* mean the same thing? Let's put them in sentences so we can use our intuitions.

- *Freda studies karate. She is able to break the board.*

- *The board is breakable.*

The meanings are related, but subtly different.

- If the meanings are different, they're different morphemes.

- So we consider them different morphemes: free root (word) *able*, bound suffix *-able*

---

# Tricky morphemes

We have a similar situation with morphemes like *-less* or *-ful*

What does the morpheme in bold mean in each sentence?

- *The bucket is* **full** *of water.*

- *A bucket*-**ful** *of water will put out the campfire.*

- *Yuri cared* **less** *than Josephine.*

-  *Yuri was care*-**less** *and made a mistake.*

--

Again, the meanings are related, but subtly different, so we consider them different morphemes:

- *able, full,* and *less* are free roots, *-able, -ful,* and *-less* are bound derivational suffixes

- If you're stuck on a morpheme, try using it in a sentence – it may clear things up

---

# Affixation

Let's move on to morphological processes. The first two should be familiar.

- Affixation: Adding an affix: a prefix, suffix, infix, or circumfix.

  - Depending on the type of affix, also called prefixation, suffixation, infixation, circumfixation.

  - **Prefixation:** *re- + visit → revisit

  - **Suffixation:** *modern + -ize → modernize

  - **Infixation:** Tagalog *bili* 'buy' → *b-um-ili* 'to buy'

  - **Circumfixation:** Indonesian *ajar* 'teach' → *pel-ajar-an* 'subject'

---

# Compounding 

Combining two or more roots into a single word

- *tree + house → treehouse*

- *blue + bird → bluebird*

- *health + care → healthcare*

--

Compound words often sound different from the words used
separately – one of the roots will be pronounced with less stress
than if it had been a separate word:

- Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin – a **tree** house.

- The child played in a **treehouse**.

---

# Compounding

Different languages have different rules for compounding.

Germanic languages are well-known for permitting lots of compounding:

--

- German: *Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän*

- Roots: *Donau- dampf- schiff- fahrts- gesellschafts- kapitän*

- Meaning: Danube- steam- ship- travel- company- captain

  'captain of the Danube Steamship Company'

---

# Compounding

English is also a Germanic language and allows this kind of compounding.

We just write these compounds with spaces:

- Amazon product title: *Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker*

--

It can be confusing what's a string of words and what's a compound with spaces, but:

- Remember that in a compound, typically not all roots are equally stressed.

  - *My cousin sells* **réal estate**. *Graceland is a* **réal estáte**!

- The meaning of compounds is sometimes non-compositional: not derived from the words.

- If it's a long string of nouns, it's probably a compound.

- In the end, spaces are a spelling convention – we don't actually pronounce them.

---

# Reduplication 


**Reduplication:** repeating all or part of a morpheme.

- Do you like him as a friend or do you *like-like* him?

- My mom always wants to go to a *fancy-shmancy* restaurant.

--

Reduplication is somewhat limited in English, but in some languages, it's more **productive** and serves an explicit **grammatical purpose**:

.pull-left[

- Indonesian (full reduplication = plural) 

- Tagalog (partial reduplication = future tense)

]


.pull-right[

*orang* "person" → *orang-orang* "people"

*bili* "buy" → *bi-bili* "will buy"

]

---

# Alternation 

**Alternation:** Changing one or more sounds within the morpheme – usually most of the sounds stay the same, but one or a few are changed. Alternation can result in irregular nouns, verbs, etc.

English has many examples. Say these words out loud. What is the difference in sound in these words? What is the difference in meaning? Do they involve inflection or derivation?

- goose → geese 

- ring → rang → rung 

- Does the baby have **teeth** yet? No, she hasn't started to **teethe**.

- This tool has no **use**. What?? I **use** it every day...

--

*Allomorphy* is technically a type of alternation, just one in which there is no difference in meaning:

- magical, magician 

**Allomorphy:** alternation that doesn't change meaning

---

# Alternation 

Why does alternation occur?

Because some sound changes only occur in certain contexts. For example:

- [t] commonly becomes [ʃ] (sh) before y sounds – a change called palatalization

  - So *edit > edition, Egypt > Egyptian, minute > minutiae*

- But this change doesn't tend to happen at the end of the word or before vowels like [a], [o]

  - So edit, editing, editor; Egypt; minute all keep their [t]

End result? Morpheme comes to be pronounced differently in different contexts


---

# Suppletion 

**Suppletion:** When an inflected form is phonetically very different from other forms of the same word. The result is even more highly irregular.

.pull-left[

- Regular past tense:

- **Suppletive past tense:**

- Regular adjective comparison: 

- **Suppletive adjective comparison:**

]

.pull-right[

*walk, walked, jump, jumped*

*is, was, go, went*

*nice, nicer, nicest, big bigger, biggest*

*good, better, best, bad, worse, worst*


]

---

# Suppletion 

Often occurs when words of different origins are reinterpreted as forms of the same word

What forms does **to be** take?

- I __ happy

- You __ happy 

- She __ happy

- Yesterday I __ happy

- Yesterday they __ happy

- I have __ happy for a while

- I like __ happy :)

--

A lot of these forms have different origins! 

- *am, is, are* → verb meaning **to be**

- *be, been, being* → verb meaning **to become**

- *was, were* → verb meaning **to stay**

--

Over time, these different verbs became interpreted as different forms of **to be**... leading to **to be** having very different forms, i.e. **suppletion**!

---

# Suppletion (not in English)

In a given language, suppletion doesn't usually affect a lot of words, but the words it does affect tend to be **very frequent**, like to be, to go, to have, to give, good, bad.

--


.pull-left[
**Spanish** *ir* "to go" 

voy "i go" → vas "you go" → va "s/he goes"  

fui "i went" → fuiste "you went" → fue "s/he went" 

iré "i will go" → irás "you will go" → irá "s/he will go"

**Danish** *lille "little, small"

singular *lille* → et *lille hus* "a little house" 

plural *små* → to små huse "two little houses"

]

.pull-right[
Latin *ire* "to go, to move"

Latin *vadere* "to go, to walk* 

Latin *esse* "to be"

Latin *ire* "to go, to move"

(compare English *little*)

(Compare English *small*)

]

---

# Multiple processes

Morphological processes

- affixation, compounding, reduplication, alternation, suppletion

It's possible for words to exhibit multiple morphological processes

--

- *break* → *broken* (alternation)

- *break* → *brok-en* (alternation + suffixing)

---

# Zero derivation 

So far we"ve seen that we can use **derivational morphemes** to change a words part of speech 

- magnet (noun) → magnet-ize (verb) 

- atom (noun) → atom-ic (adjective)

BUT English, for example, can sometimes change a word's part of speech without adding anything!

.pull-left[
- I'm going to jump (V) over that railing.

- Please email (N) me about that later.

]

.pull-right[

- That was a nice jump (N)!

- I emailed (V) you yesterday.

]

**Zero derivation:** deriving a new word without adding anything

--

Not all languages can do this.

**Spanish**

- un post (a social media posy) → postear (to post on social media)

---

# Acronyms

**Acronym:** a word formed from the initials of other words

- NASA → National Air and Space Administrayion 

--

If each letter is pronounced separately, it's called **initialism**

- FBI, CIA

--

Acronyms are a fairly recent thing, since the 20th century (from military, government, tech, and corporate terms), so it's not super common 

- laser → Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation 

- scuba → Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus

---

# Blends 

Another more recent way of making words is **blend** (aka **portmanteau**): taking parts of words that are not morphemes and combining them

- smog = smoke + fog 

- brunch = breakfast + lunch

Most English words are not blends, so **beware of folk etymologies!**

- **etymology:** study of the origins of words 

- **folk etymology:** false claims about the origins of a word

--

*Oxford English Dictionary, Etymonline,* and even *Wiktionary* are great sources about the origins of words. And remember that certain morphological processes are more common than others.

---

# Clipping

**Clipping:** making new morphemes by shortening ("clipping") an existing word

- advertisement → ad 

- laboratory → lab 

- veterinarian → vet 

Clipping isn't part of the morphology of the original word! It's a new creation! 

- *laboratory*'s root is *labor*, NOT *lab*

But, we can use this new root morpheme to make new words (clipped compounds)

- *lab-coat, ad-break*

---

# Reanalysis

What morphemes do the following words have? What does each morpheme mean?

- algebra

- hamburger 

- invent, prevent, event 

--

**Reanalysis** or **rebracketing** is when morpheme boundaries are *reinterpreted* over time

- a napron → an apron (this one blows my mind)

Morpheme boundaries can be **lost**...

- al-jabr (Arabic) → algebra (English)

Morpheme boundaries can be **moved**...

- Hamburg-er (German) "person/thing from Hamburg" → ham-burger (English)

---

# Reanalysis

Morpheme boundaries can become ambiguous 

- Latin *in-* 'in' + *venire* 'to come'

- Latin *pre-* 'before' + *venire* 

- Latin *ex-* 'out' + *venire*

→ English invent, prevent, event

---

# Reanalysis (how??)

How does reanalysis happen?

--

As kids, we form our mental grammar by **listening** to our caregivers and **deducing the rules** that account for the things they say

But sometimes the rules we deduce are different from the rules they're actually using... this is a reason why language changes over time!

--

In the case of morphology, this can result in **reanalysis**

- Generation 1:  [əneɪ̯ prən] = "a napron"

- Generation 2: hears this sound sequence, and interprets it as "an apron"

  - Generation 2's grammar has changed and they can generalize the new "apron" word to other contexts, such as *the apron, two aprons*
  
---

# Note on etymology

This is also why we can't fully rely on etymology (the origin of words) to explain words today:

- They don't always mean or have the same morphemes as their original sources.

Generally speaking (unless we're specifically studying language change):

- We should try to analyze language synchronically – as it is spoken at one moment in time

- Rather than diachronically – as it has changed over time

- And this makes sense!! – you don't have to know a language's history to speak it fluently!

---

# Key takeaways 

We have many different ways of using morphology to build new words!

- affixation, compounding, reduplication, alternation, suppletion, reanalysis, zero-derivation

We've also seen the rise of new word-formation processes in the past century:

- acronyms, blends, clippings

- Remember these are newer word-formation processes, so take it with a grain of salt when someone tries to tell you a word derives from an acronym or blend.

- ...It might be a false etymology

# Order of affixation 

- consider the words *unbelievable* and *renewable*. 

  - How many morphemes do they each have? 
  
  - What's the root? Are there prefixes or suffixes? 

--

- Now imagine you start with the root and then add affixes until you get the full word. Do you start with the prefix or suffix? Which do you add first?

  - Is it *un* + *believable* **or** *unbelieve* + *able*? Why? 
  
  - Is it *renew* + *able* **or** *re* + *newable*? Why?

---

# Order of affixation 

- Even though *unbelievable* and *renewable* both have three morphemes (prefix-root-suffix), there seems to be something different about the order in which the morphemes are added to the root!

--

In *un*-**believ**-*able* you add the suffix first and the prefix second
  
--

  1. Does adding an affix make a real word? **believ**-*able* is a real word, but \**un*-**believe** is not
    
    - What does the word mean? *unbelievable* means *not believable*, not *able to be unbelieved* 

--

In *re*-**new**-*able*, you add the suffix first and the prefix second

--

   1. Does adding an affix make a real word? *re*-**new** is a real word, but \***new**-*able* is not
  
  - What does the word mean? *renewable* means *able to be renewed*, not *newable again*

---

# Order of affixation 

This suggest that the **order of affixation**- the order in which you add affixes to a root- plays a role in the morphology of a word!

--

- different words have different orders of affixation 

- order of affixation is part of our mental grammar (what we know about a word as speakers)

--

- we can test a word's order of affixation by:

  - adding an affix and seeing if it makes a real word

--

  - trying to understand what the word means. if your definition involves some smaller combination of the root and an affix, it suggests that the affix is added first 

--

***neither of these tests works 100% of the time, so you should try a combination of them!***

## Hierarchical structure

- order of affixation is somehow connected to the *meaning* of a word

- the fact that we can't add affixes in any order suggests that words have a **hierarchical structure**

--

- we can visualize this structure with a **tree diagram**!

---

# Hierarchical structure

We can visualize this structue with a tree diagram...

- we **start at the bottom** with the root and **build upward**, adding affixes until we get to the full word at the top

--

- an alternative notation is **labeled bracketing**, which is more compact but perhaps less intuitive

--

  - [<sub>Adj</sub> un [<sub>V</sub> [<sub>V</sub> believe ] able ]]

  - [<sub>Adj</sub> [<sub>V</sub> re [<sub>Adj</sub> new ]] able ]

# Trees 

**How to draw a morphological tree:**

1. identify the word's morphemes and write them out separately in one row *(leave plenty of space above them!)*

--

2. identify the root(s) and label their part of speech

--

3. look at the morphemes immediately before and after the root. Which one is added first? Draw lines upward connecting them, and label the new word's part of speech

--

4. this new word becomes the base you'll keep building off of. Repeat step 3 using this new base instead of the root, and continue until you have no unconnected morphemes left

# Morphological ambiguity 

- this word (***undoable***) is an example of a word with an ambiguous structure
