# Recap from week 1

---

# Basic ideas from last week

- Language is a systematic, rule-governed communication system.

--

- The rules of language comprise a mental grammar, aka linguistic competence

--

- Speakers use their mental grammar to produce and understand language

--

- Speakers of all languages and dialects have a mental grammar – though it may differ from what is found in a textbook or language class

--

- Mental grammar can vary from speaker to speaker and community to community

--

- We use the term grammatical to describe language that fits a speaker’s mental rules – non-standard language is grammatical, as long as it sounds natural to a speaker

--

- As English speakers, we each have a mental grammar – so in this class we will be using our own intuitions about what sounds natural/what doesn’t to figure out the rules of English

# **Morphology**

### (the study of word structures)

---

# **Exercise** (intuitions about word structure)

**Which of the following words sound like a possible English word to you?**

--

**Discuss with a partner:**

- Do you agree on your answers? 

- If a word doesn’t sound possible, how could you change it to make them possible? *(for example, replacing a prefix/root/suffix)*

--

1. speakless

2. beautifulness

3. uncar

4. reglorify

5. horseable

6. stretchity

7. dequick

8. thinkly

# Rules of word structure

---

# Rules of word structure

We know that words can consist of smaller parts like **prefixes, roots, and suffixes**.

--

- But as it turns out, we **can’t just combine them randomly** – there are rules, and we have intuitions about those rules even if we’re not aware of it!

--

- **For example:**

  - *un-* can be added to a verb (*un-do*) or adjective (*unhappy*), but not a noun (**uncar*)

  - *-able* can be added to a verb (*read-able*), but not a noun (**horse-able*) or adjective (**happy-able*)

--

- This means we have a mental grammar for the rules of word structure: **Morphology**

# **What's a morpheme?**

--

### smallest linguistic unit with meaning

---

# Morphemes

**"Smallest linguistic unit with meaning"**

- Smallest linguistic unit means *shortest sequence of sounds*

- What's the shortest sequence of sounds with meaning you can break these words into?

--

1. schoolbus

2. bee

3. opener

4. silliest 

5. groundhog

---

# Morphemes

Morphemes are **not** the same as syllables

--

- *elephant* has three syllables, but one morpheme

- *el, e, phant* don’t mean anything –
they’re syllables, but not morphemes

--

Morphemes are made of **sounds**, not letters:

--

- *silly* and *silli-* are two ways of spelling the **same morpheme**

- same with **big**, **bigg**-*er* and **lie**, **ly**-*ing*

--

- Don’t worry about spelling differences! **Spelling doesn't really matter for linguists!**

--

It’s okay for a word to have just one morpheme - every word has **at least one** morpheme, some have more.

--

- Words with one morpheme are called **monomorphemic**.

  - *bee, elephant*

--

- Words with two or more morphemes are **polymorphemic**.

  - *school-bus, open-er, silli-est*

--

- Sometimes you’ll hear terms like bimorphemic or trimorphemic – what do you think they mean?

---

# Morphemes

**Morphemes can have two types of meaning**

--

.pull-left[

**Lexical meaning**

- This is like a dictionary definition. (**lexicon = mental dictionary**)

- Consider these words: *apple-sauce, white-water, over-think*

- Morphemes like *apple, water, think* are easy to define: they have **lexical meaning**

]

--

.pull-right[

**Grammatical function**

- Now consider these words: *cat-s, laugh-ed, happi-ness, calm-ly*

-  What do the morphemes *-s, -ed, -ness, -ly* mean?

-  Rather than a dictionary definition, they have a **grammatical function**

- Their meaning is related to how the word behaves in a sentence:
*-s* = PLURAL, *-ed* = PAST, *-ness* = NOUN, *-ly* = ADVERB

- Is *-lessness* a morpheme?

- Is *un-* a morpheme in both *untied* and *uncle*?

- Is *-s* a morpheme in both *sleeps* and *lens*?

# Terminology 

---

# Homophones and allomorphs

.pull-left[

**Homophones**

- sound the same but have different meanings

  - *paper-s* → **-s = PLURAL**
  
  - *see-s* → **-s = 3SG PRESENT**
  
- these are **different morphemes** that happen to sound the same

]

--

.pull-right[

**Allomorphs**

- mean the same thing, but are pronounced differently 

  - **magic**-*al*, **magic**-*ian* 
  
  - **clear**-*ing*, **clar**-*ify*

- Each of these is a **single morpheme** with multiple pronunciations.

- Each pronunciation is called an **allomorph** of that morpheme.

]

---

# Types of morphemes

- **roots vs. affixes**

  - where in the word does the morpheme occur?

--

- **free vs. bound**

  - can the morpheme occur alone as a separate word?

--

- **inflectional vs. derivational**

  - does adding the morpheme create a new word?
  
--

.pull-left[
**Root**

- "base” morpheme to which other morphemes are attached

- Contributes the core meaning of the word.

- If a word has a single morpheme, that morpheme is a root.

Examples: **danc**-*ing*, *dis*-**appear**, **help**-*less-ness*, **elephant**

]

--

.pull-right[
**Affix**

- Morpheme that is attached to the root

- **Prefixes** go before root, **suffixes** go after root – *both are affixes*

- A word can have multiple prefixes or suffixes.

Examples: **pre**-*flight, act*-**ive**, **un**-*trust*-**worthy**, *will*-**ing-ly**

]

---

# Compound words

A word with <u>two+ roots</u> is called a <u>compound word</u>:

  - **house-cat, ginger-bread, sun-flower**
  
--
  
A word with <u>one root</u> is called <u>simple</u>, even if it has affixes:

  - **cat, eat**-*s*, **critic**-*al*, *be*-**friend**

---

# Types of affixes

Most common affixes are **prefixes and suffixes**

--

- Some languages also have **infixes**, which go inside root:

--

  - Tagalog *bili* ‘buy’ → *b*-**um**-*ili* ‘to buy’

- or **circumfixes**, which go around root:

--

  - Indonesian *ajar* ‘teach’ → **pel**-*ajar*-**an** ‘buy’

  - English *bold* → **em**-*bold*-**en**

--

- infixes and circumfixes are a bit rare. If you think you’ve found…

  - an infix, check it’s really *inside the root* and not two pre/suffixes.

  - a circumfix, check they’re inseparable and mean one thing *together*

---

# Free and bound morphemes

**Free morphemes** can appear as independent words

- *apple, sweet. happily, for, the*

--

**Bound morphemes** can only appear as part of a word, not as an independent word:
  
  - *un-, -er, -ly, -ing*

--

- **Affixes** are bound, by definition.

--

- **Roots** are usually free: *blue, berry, blue-berry*

--

  - But consider *cran-berry*. Is the root **cran** free or bound?

  - In Spanish, verbs require suffixes, so verbal roots are bound:
**cant**-*ar* ‘to sing’, **cant**-*o* ‘I sing’, **cant**-*as* ‘you sing’, but not ***cant**

# Practice

For each morpheme in the word **camp-ground-s**:

- Is it a root or affix? 

  - What kind of affix? (prefix or suffix?)

- Is it free or bound?

- Is **campgrounds** simple or compound?

For each morpheme in the word **modern-iz-ation**:

- Is it a root or affix? 

  - What kind of affix? (prefix or suffix?)

- Is it free or bound?

- Is **modernization** simple or compound?

# Inflectional vs. derivational morphemes

---

# Inflectional morphemes

Consider these words and affixes. For each word:

- The **first affix** doesn’t really change the word’s core meaning –
instead, it adds *grammatical nuance*

--

  - *violin-s* = still means violin, just more than one of them

  - *agree-d* = still means agree, just in the past
  
  - *larg-er* = still means large, just more-so

--

The process of adding grammatical nuance is called **inflection**, and these affixes are therefore *inflectional morphemes*

- Inflectional morphemes are used to inflect words.

--

- Inflecting a verb is also known as *conjugating*

- Inflecting a noun is sometimes known as *declining*

--

- In English, they’re mostly used to conjugate verbs (*jump → jump-ed*), pluralize nouns (*cat → cat-s*), and form the comparative and superlative of adjectives (*bright → bright-er → bright-est*).

---

# Derivational morphemes

The **second affix** changes the word’s meaning substantially, and can even change its **part of speech** (*noun, verb, adjective*)

--

By adding the affix, we make a new word with its core meaning changed in some way.

--

  - *violin* = musical instrument (an object, noun)

    - *violin-ist* = person who plays a violin (a person, noun)

--

  - *agree* = share an opinion (verb)

    - *agree-ment* = contract, act of agreeing (noun)

--

  - *large* = big (adjective)

    - *en-large* = make big (verb)

--

The process of forming new words is called **derivation**, and these affixes are therefore *derivational morphemes*

--

  - *simple → simpl-ify*
  
  - *exist → exist-ence* 
  
  - *pack → un-pack*

# Morphological analysis

---

# Morphological analysis


**Morphological analysis is a technique for figuring out how the morphology of a language works**

- You can use it to learn how the morphology of an unfamiliar language works, as long as you have a set of words with different morphemes and their translations (*glosses*) into English

--

**Steps:**

1. Identify any repeated sequences of sounds in the dataset - these may be morphemes!

2. Identify any repeated meanings in the English glosses

3. Try to match each meaning from **Step 2** with a potential morpheme from **Step 1**

1. Identify any repeated sequences of sounds in the dataset - these may be morphemes!

2. Identify any repeated meanings in the English glosses

3. Try to match each meaning from **Step 2** with a potential morpheme from **Step 1**

  - Try to find two words that differ by just one meaning or morpheme 
  
  - As you work through this, look out for potential homophones or allomorphs
  
  - Don't be afraid to revise your hypotheses if the data suggests you're on the wrong track!
