**Phoneme:** a set of sounds that speakers of a language treat as being the same

- written in **/slashes/**

--

**Allophone:** each individual possible sound that a phoneme could surface as

# Review

**Contrastive distribution:** when switching out one *phoneme* for another results in a different meaning

--

- these word pairs are called *minimal pairs*

- they detect which sounds are **phonemes**

- *that vs. mat*

# Practice: minimal pairs 

*Are the following pairs of words minimal pairs? If they are, what phonemic contrast do they illustrate? Focus on the SOUNDS, not the spelling!*

1. wait - straight **not minimal pair.**

2. taught - toot **minimal pair, /a/ - /u/**

3. fine - line **minimal pair, /f/ - /l/**

4. frog - log **not minimal pair.**

5. skink - tin **not minimal pair.**

6. boot - lute **minimal pair, /b/ - /l/**

7. ferris - fair **not minimal pair.**

8. might - fright **not minimal pair.**

---

# Practice: minimal pairs 

*Find a minimal pair to illustrate the following contrasts (the phonemes do not need to be at the beginning of the word!)*



1. /f/ - /v/ **fan - van; feign - vein**

2. /b/ - /p/ **plot - blot, bus - pus, bear - pear, bark - park**

3. /s/ - /z/ **racer - razor, sue - zoo, sack - Zach**

4. /θ/ – /ð/ **teeth - teethe**

5. /n/ - /m/ **noon - moon, name - maim, mice - nice, neat - meat**

6. /a/ - /u/ **lot - loot, rot - root**

7. /d/ - /t/ **dime - time, dent - tent, content - contend, bent - bend**

8. /i/ - /ʌ/ **seen - sun, eve - of, brie - bruh, dream - drum**

9. /t/ - /ð/ **tea - thee, tau - thou, ten - then**

10. /t/ - /θ/ **tree - three, taught - thought, tum - thumb**

# Review


**Complementary distribution:** when switching a sound out for another sound *does not* change the meaning

--

- allophones of the same phoneme

- *example. [t] versus [tʰ] in English*

--

- different environments cause the sound to change, but in the minds of speakers its still considered one sound

--

**Phonotactics:** rules for how we combine sounds to form words

- English doesn't allow the velar nasal at the beginning of a word, but Cook Islands Māori does


---

# Review

Different languages contrast different sounds, **but,** there are some common trends.

--

```{r, out.height="50%", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/trends.png")
```

--

If a language has the sounds on the right of each row, then it will also have the corresponding sound on the left.

# Review


**How to determine whether a sound is a phoneme or allophone:**

.pull-left[
1. for each word, write the preceding and following segment for the sound you're testing 

2. write down each different environment (again, looking at both the preceding and following sounds)

4. see if there are any common environments that both potential phonemes share
]


.pull-right[
```{r, out.height="100%", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/phonetic_environments.png")
```
]

---

# Review

We use **minimal pairs** (contrastive distribution) to find evidence that two sounds are *phonemes*.

--

**Notes:**

- \# means word boundary (beginning or end of the word) is on that side

- _ represents the sound you're testing. it's like a placeholder

# Phonological processes

**Assimilation:** when a sound segment changes to become more similar to another nearby sound segment, which we can measure in terms of comparing their features

--

- *example: English plural /-s/ changes to [z] after a voiced stop*

--

**Dissimilation:**  when a sound changes to become less similar to another segment

--

- *example: Latin [peregrinu] → Eng. [pilgrim]*

- The first **r** dissimilates to an **l** to become less like the second **r**

---

# Phonological processes

**Insertion/Epenthesis:** when a sound segment is added to a word

--

- *example: English "stress" → Japanese [su.to.re.su]*

--

**Deletion/Elision:** when a sound is removed from a word

--

- *example: "rock and roll" → "rock n roll"*

--

**Strengthening:** processes by which sound segments get *"stronger"*

--

**Weakening:** processes by which sound segments get *"weaker"*

- ***...what do we mean by "stronger" and "weaker?"***

# Sonority scale

***higher sonority*** (**weaker**)

  vowels
  
  glides

  liquids
  
  nasals
  
  fricatives

  affricates
  
  stops 
  
***lower sonority*** (**stronger**)
]

--

.pull-right[

- **voiced** sounds are **more sonorous** than voiceless sounds.

# Strengthening and weakening (examples)


**Strengthening**

- *th*-stopping in some American English varieties: *with* [wɪt], *them* [dɛm] (fricative → stop)

--

**Weakening**

- /t/ → [ɾ] in *butter, better, water* (/t/ becomes voiced and is no longer a stop)

# Practice (phonological processes)

***What phonological processes do these examples exhibit? How can you tell?***

1. English speakers often pronounce "hamster" as *"hampster"*

  - **ANSWER:** epenthesis/insertion 

2. The prefix in- ‘not’, as in *indirect* and *intolerant* changes to im- in *impossible, imbalance*.

  - **Bonus:** *in-* is pronounced [ɪŋ] in *incredible, ingratitude*
  
  - **ANSWERS:** both are place assimilation

3. "Tsunami" in Japanese is pronounced [tsunami], but in English it is often pronounced [sunami].

  - **ANSWER:** if [ts] is an affricate, this is strengthening
  
---

# Practice (phonological processes)

***What phonological processes do these examples exhibit? How can you tell?***

4. The [t] in *operate, create, mutate, vacate* becomes [ʃ] in *operation, creation, mutation, vacation*.

  - **ANSWER:** weakening

5. The adjectival suffix *-al*, as in *naval, vocal, animal, capital, coronal*, becomes *-ar* in words like *solar, lunar, velar, polar, angular, popular*. 

  - **Bonus:** why *floral, lateral,* not \*florar, \*laterar?
  
  - **ANSWER:** both are dissimilation

6. The [ɾ] in *atom* [æɾəm], *metal* [mɛɾəl] becomes [tʰ] in the adjective forms *atomic* [ətʰɑmɪk], *metallic* [mətʰælik].

  - **ANSWER:** this is strengthening

1. for each word, write the preceding and following segment **for the sound you're testing**

2. do they occur in the same or different environments?

  - *same = contrastive = seperate phonemes*

3. what do the environments of allophones have in common?

4. simplify the environments (*V_V*, *#_C*, etc.)

For the pair of sounds [i]-[ɛ] and [n]-[ŋ]:

--

- write the phonetic environments in which each sound occurs 

--

- are the two sounds in complementary or contrastive distribution ?

--

- are the two sounds separate phonemes or allophones of the same phoneme in Italian?

  - *if they are allophones,* what is the phonological rule for the change?

# Italian (ANSWERS)

**Phonetic environments:**

| i | ɛ | n | ŋ |
| :------- | :------: | -------: | -------: |
| t __ n  | t __ n | i __ t | i __ g |
| t __ ŋ  | t __ ŋ | ɛ __ d | ɛ __ g |
|         | dʒ __ n | ɛ __ t | u __ g |
|         |         | o __ e | a __ k |
|         |         |        | a __ g |

**Complementary or contrastive distribution?**

**i and ɛ** are *contrastive distribution*, so they are *phonemes.*

- no need to write a rule if they are phonemes

**n and ŋ** are *complementary distribution*, so they are *allophones.*

- **phonological rule:** n -> ŋ / __ velar consonant
