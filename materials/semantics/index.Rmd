# Review!

# Review from lecture 

## Different levels of meaning in language 

**Literal meaning**

- <u>semantics</u> studies literal meaning in language 

**Implied meaning**

- <u>pragmatics</u> studies implied meaning in language 

**Social meaning**

- <u>sociolinguistics</u> and <u>linguistic anthropology</u> study social meaning 


---

# Review from lecture 

### Discuss in small-ish groups.

- lexical semantics vs. compositional semantics

- sense vs. reference

  - <u>sense:</u> a mental concept of a words meaning 
  
  - <u>reference:</u> the set of things in the world that the word refers to; useful for categorizing new items we come across
  
--

- possible worlds

- truth values

--

- synonym vs. antonym

- hypernym vs. hyponym

# Semantic relations (review still)

---

# Semantic relations 

- **synonym:** words that have the same reference / refer to the same set of things in the world 

  - *drinks* and *beverages*

- **hypernym:** words whose reference is a _superset_ of another words reference

- **hyponym:** words whose reference is a _subset_ of another words reference

  - *gecko* (hyponym) vs. *lizard* (hypernym)
  
- **antonym:** words that have opposite meanings

  - *subtypes on next slide....*

---

# Semantic relations

**antonym:** words that have opposite meanings

--

- <u>Complementary pairs:</u> items that can't be in both categories 

  - *alive* vs. *dead*
  
- <u>Gradable pairs:</u> opposite ends of a scale 

  - *young* vs. *old*
  
- <u>Reverses:</u> opposite directions 

  - *up* vs. *down*
  
- <u>Converses:</u> same action, different perspective 

  - *buy* vs. *sell*

---

# Semantic relations 

Are the following word pairs *synonyms, antonyms,* or a *hypernym-hyponym* pair?

1. bird - avian 

2. bird - sparrow 

3. bird - animal

4. rodent - rat

5. good - evil

6. to clean - to mess up/dirty

7. ***more??***

# ENTAILMENT

## sentence **p** entails sentence **q** if and only if **q** is *true* whenever **p** is *true*

### "whenever" there is a possible world where the sentence **p** is *true*, while **q** is *false*

# ENTAILMENT: example

### <u>Quartz is a linguistics student</u>

# entails  

### <u>Quartz is a student</u>.

### if Quartz is **NOT** a <u>student</u>, then it's impossible for Quartz to be a <u>linguistics student</u>

# Practice: entailment

# Practice: entailment 

For each pair of sentences, does the first sentence **(a)** entail the second sentence **(b)**? 

--

**a.** Charles III is the King of the United Kingdom.

**b.** Queen Elizabeth II was Charles's mother.

-  ***No.*** The truth of (b) is not dependent on the truth of (a).

--

**a.** I am very very very very very tired.

**b.** I am tired.

- **Yes, entailment.** There is no universe where one is not tired when one is very(×7) tired.

--

**a.** Chicken Little believes the sky is falling.

**b.** The sky is falling.

- ***No.*** Even if the sky is not falling, Chicken Little might still believe it.

---

# Practice: entailment (Gible)

**a.** Gible is a silly tabby cat.

**b.** Gible is a cat.

- **Yes, entailment.**

# Practice: entailment

For each pair of sentences, does the first sentence **(a)** entail the second sentence **(b)**?

**a.** Bob and Linda live above a restaurant on Ocean Avenue.

**b.** Bob lives above a restaurant on Ocean Avenue.

- **Yes, entailment.**

--

**a.** The kids trick-or-treated on Halloween.

**b.** The kids trick-or-treated in scary costumes on Halloween.

-  ***No.*** If (a.) is true, then the costumes need not be scary.

--

**a.** Jake stopped smoking.

**b.** Jake used to smoke.

- **Yes, entailment.**

---

# Practice: entailment

**a.** Keng's car still has Wisconsin license plates on it.

**b.** Keng has a car.

- **Yes, entailment.**

# Practice: entailment 

**Think of three sentences that are entailed by each of these sentences:**

1. The spotted lanternfly is an insect that has spread invasively to New Jersey and can cause damage to forests and fruit crops.

  - *The spotted lanternfly has spread to New Jersey; The spotted lanternfly is an insect; The spotted lanternfly can cause damage to fruit crops; etc*
  
--

2. The starship Enterprise explored strange new worlds, sought out new life and new civilizations, and boldly went where no one had gone before.

  - *Enterprise is a starship; Enterprise explored some worlds; Enterprise sought out new life; etc*
  
  
---

# Practice: entailment

**Think of three sentences that are entailed by each of these sentences:**

3. Controversially, DeLa chose to eliminate herself from the competition after winning the lip-sync battle, which allowed Trixie, Kennedy, and Shangela to all stay in the competition.

  - *DeLa won the lip-sinc battle; Trixie stayed in the competition; DeLa eliminating herself was controversial; etc.*
  
--
  
4. Mario defeated Bowser, but then all he found in the dungeon was Toad, who told him that the princess was in another castle.

  - *The princess was not in the dungeon; Mario defeated Bowser; Toad said that the princess was in another castle; etc.*

# Mutual entailment 

### **p** entails **q** <u>AND</u> **q** entails **p**.

# Mutual entailment 

## Examples

**p:** Merlin is immortal.

**q:** Merlin is incapable of dying.

--

**p:** He is a bachelor.

**q:** He is an unmarried man.

# Set theory (formal review)

## Set: a collection of items

- order doesn't matter 

- items can be repeated, but they don't "count" as separate items 
  
  - {a,e,i,o,u} = {a,a,e,e,i,o,o,u}

**Member**

- an item in a set is also called a member of that set

---

# Set theory (formal review)

## List vs. predicate notation

- **List notation:** specifies a set by listing its members between {brackets}

  - *R* = { Gouda, Soup, Falafel, Beef, Butter, Sesame }
  
  
- **Predicate notation:** defines what is in the set without listing everything 

  - *R* = { *x* | *x* is a rodent }

  - "*R* equals the set of elements *x*, such that *x* is a rodent" 
  
  - normal words: "the set of all rodents"
  
  - "such that" ( | )
  

---

# Set theory (formal review)

## Set relations

**subset (⊆):** 

- *A* is a subset of *B* if every element of *A* is also an element of *B*

**proper subset (⊂):** 

- *A* is a proper subset of *B* if *A* is a subset of *B* and they are not identical

**identity (=):** 

- two sets are identical/equal if they have exactly the same elements

---

# Set theory (formal review)

## Set operations

**union (∪)**

- produces a new set which contains all elements that belong to both sets (including elements in both sets)


**intersection (∩)**

- produces a new set that only contains all elements that belong to BOTH sets


---

# Set theory (formal review)

## Set operations

**difference (-)** 

- the difference of *A* and *B* is a new set which contains all elements that belong to *A*, but NOT *B*


**complement (')**

- produces a new set which contains all elements in the relevant universe that are NOT in the set



---

# Set theory (formal review)

## Cardinality: the number of elements in a set 

- **singleton set:** a set with cardinality = 1
  
- **null set/empty set:** a set with cardinality = 0 

  - {} = Ø "empty set"
  

### Other notational things

- when talking about the  *meaning* of a word, and not its structure, use [[double brackets]]
