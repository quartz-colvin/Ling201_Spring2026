# A girl saw a bear with a telescope.

This sentence has two possible interpretations. What are they? Who has the telescope?

---

# A girl saw a bear with a telescope

.pull-left[

**Interpretation 1**

*A girl used a telescope to see a bear*

```{r, out.width="120%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/saw_with_telescope.png")
```

]

.pull-right[
**Interpretation 2**

*A girl saw a bear that had a telescope*

```{r, out.width="120%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/bear_with_telescope.png")
```

# A girl saw a bear with a telescope

This is an example of a **structurally ambiguous** sentence.

--

We can use syntax trees to visualize its two possible structures.

- In this case, these syntax trees show how there are two ways to interpret what [*with a telescope*] modifies.

--

This means that *the meaning of a sentence isn't just the sum of its words:*

- **Syntactic structure also contributes to meaning.**

--

So let's take some time to understand these structures and how to draw them as trees.

# Types of phrases

**Syntax trees** show how words are combined into **constituents** and how constituents are related.

Another name for constituents is **phrases**, and we'll be talking about the following phrase types:

--

Each phrase type has a **head word** and is named after that head word's part of speech, and each phrase contains that head word *and all the words that modify that head word:*

--

- **NP – noun phrase** (*man, the man, the happy man, the man with the hat*)

--

- **PP – prepositional phrase** (*into the forest, by the author, for good luck*)

--

- **AdjP – adjective phrase** (*happy, extremely angry*)

--

- **AdvP – adverb phrase** (*quickly, very quickly*)

--

- **VP – verb phrase** (*eats, eats pizza, eats quickly, eats pizza quickly at noon*)

--

- **TP – tense phrase** or ***sentence*** (*John eats pizza quickly. I saw a dog by the tree.*)

---

# Noun phrases (NP)

---

# NPs

A noun phrase consists of a noun and all the words that modify it.

--

The simplest NP is a single noun:

- *Harriet, dogs, soup, snow*

--

A NP can also include any of the following:

- A **determiner:** *<u>the</u> hat, <u>my</u> shoes, <u>this</u> idea, <u>which</u> tree*

--

- One or more **adjective phrases** (AdjP): *<u>blue</u> sky, a <u>great</u> time, <u>big</u> <u>red</u> trucks*

  - **Note:** an adjective will always go in a separate AdjP, for reasons we'll discuss later.

--

- One or more **prepositional phrases** (PP): *spaghetti <u>with</u> meatballs, trees <u>in</u> the yard, the tall bridge <u>over</u> the river*

---

# Phrase structure rules (NPs)

We use phrase structure rules (PSRs) to specify what elements a phrase can contain.

PSRs have the following format:

--

.pull-left[
- **X**P → **X** <span style="color:blue">Y Z</span>
]

.pull-right[
phrase **type X** is composed of elements **X**, <span style="color:blue">Y</span>, <span style="color:blue">Z</span>, in that order
]

--

We can write a PSR to account for each type of NP we've seen so far

.pull-left[

- *dog* (simple noun)

- *the dog* (determiner-noun)

- *friendly dog* (adjective-noun)

- *dog in the park* (noun-PP)

- *the friendly dog in the park* (determiner-adj-noun-PP)

]

.pull-right[

**N**P → **N**

**N**P → <span style="color:blue">D</span> **N**

**N**P → <span style="color:blue">AdjP</span> **N**

**N**P → **N** <span style="color:blue">PP</span>

**N**P → <span style="color:blue">D AdjP</span> **N** <span style="color:blue">PP</span>

]

---

# Phrase structure rules (NPs)

We can combine all of these NP rules into one rule:

- **N**P → <span style="color:blue">(D) (AdjP+)</span> **N** <span style="color:blue">(PP+)</span>

--

**Notes**

- order matters - elements always appear in the order given in the rule

- parentheses = optional 

- no parentheses = required 

- "+" = one or more allowed

--

So this rule means that an NP consists of:

- optional determiner, one or more optional adjective phrase(s), noun, one or more optional prepositional phrase(s) – *in that order*

---

.pull-left[

# Syntax trees 



- phrase structure rules can be used to draw **syntax trees!**

- to draw a syntax tree: 

  - write the words **at the bottom**
  
  - label their parts of speech 
  
  - figure out how they combine into phrases 
  
  - Write phrase type above and connect all its elements
with lines – some phrases contain other phrases.

  - Tree should reflect an existing PSR: phrase type on left of PSR at top elements on right of PSR at bottom

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="70%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/syntax_trees.png")

# Adjective phrases (AdjP) and Adverb phrases (AdvP)

Consider the following sentence. Are *happy* and *quickly* constituents?

- The <span style="color:blue">happy</span> dog ran <span style="color:blue">quickly</span>.

--

Let's try some tests:

- *The dog who ran quickly was <span style="color:blue">happy.</span>* (movement)

- *How was the dog who ran quickly? <span style="color:blue">Happy</span>!* (stand alone)

- *How did the happy dog run? <span style="color:blue">Quickly</span>!* (stand alone)

- *The happy dog ran <span style="color:blue">like that</span>.* (replacement)

--

Adjectives and adverbs are their own constituents, so they need to be put into their own phrases:

- AdjP and AdvP

---

# Adjective phrase (AdjP)

.pull-left[
Most basic AdjP: one adjective (**AdjP → Adj**)

- We can insert it into an NP as shown.

**Modification Rule:** a phrase that modifies a word must be a sibling of that word.


By making the AdjP for *happy* a **sibling** of the N *turtle*, we're showing that *happy* modifies *turtle*.

We can verify they are siblings by checking they have the same **parent**: both the AdjP and the N *turtle* have NP as parent.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="65%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/very_slow_turtle.png")
```
]

---

# Adjective phrase (AdjP)

.pull-left[

AdjPs can optionally contain an adverb phrase: *very slow*

- Let's modify our PSR: **AdjP → (AdvP) Adj**

Since the adverb modifies the adjective:

- The adverb needs to go in its own AdvP.

- That AdvP needs to be a sibling of the adjective.

- That is, they need to be children of the same AdjP.
]


.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="65%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/very_slow_turtle.png")
```
]

# Adjective phrase (AdjP)

Suppose you had two adjectives in a row. Are those adjectives in separate AdjPs or the same one? Why or why not?

- *the big gray dog*

**Discuss!!!**

---

# Adjective phrase (AdjP)

.pull-left[

Suppose you had two adjectives in a row. Are those adjectives in separate AdjPs or the same one? Why or why not?

- *the big gray dog*

**Each phrase has its own head word** – for AdjP, that's an adjective:

- With a phrase [*big gray*], which is the head?

So, **each adjective needs its own phrase.**

- The same is true of nouns, verbs, adverbs –
each needs its own phrase.

And each AdjP describes *dog*, so they're both siblings of *dog*.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="65%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/big_gray_dog.png")
```

]

---

# Adverb phrase (AdvP)

.pull-left[

Most basic AdvP: one adverb (AdvP → Adv)

- It can be inserted into an AdjP as shown
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="40%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/very_happy.png")
```

]

--

.pull-left[

If you have two adverbs in a row, they will be in nested like this, to show that the first adverb modifies the second.

- General rule for English AdvP: **AdvP → (AdvP) Adv**

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="40%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/very_quickly.png")
```
]

---

# Prepositional phrase (PP)

.pull-left[

All PPs consist of a preposition (P) and an NP:

- **PP → P NP**

Other examples of PP (note it's always P + NP):

- *<u>in</u> the park*

- *<u>by</u> the tree*

- *<u>with</u> your friends*

- *<u>under</u> the sky*

- *<u>for</u> my mom*

- *<u>at</u> the beach*

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="50%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/at_the_show.png")
```
]

---

# Prepositional phrase (PP)

.pull-left[

Every PP contains an NP.

But recall an NP can contain a PP...

- which would contain another NP...

- which could contain a PP...

- which would contain an NP...

- and so on theoretically to infinity

- though in practice there's a cognitive limit

This is an example of **recursion**, an important feature of language.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="120%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/long_PP.png")
```
]

---

# Prepositional phrase (PP)

These phrases both contain two PPs, but have different syntactic structures. **Why?**

```{r, out.width="100%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/tolkein_trees.png")
```

---

# Prepositional phrase (PP)

Recall the **modification rule** – a phrase that modifies a word must be its sibling


Remember to follow this rule as you draw syntax trees!

```{r, out.width="100%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/tolkein_constituents.png")
```

# PSR summary

So far we’ve seen four types of phrase, and a PSR to generate each one:

- **NP → (D) (AdjP+) N (PP+)**

- **AdjP → (AdvP) Adj**

- **AdvP → (AdvP) Adv**

- **PP → P NP**
