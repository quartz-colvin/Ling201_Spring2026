# A girl saw a bear with a telescope.

This sentence has two possible interpretations. What are they? Who has the telescope?

---

# A girl saw a bear with a telescope

.pull-left[

**Interpretation 1**

*A girl used a telescope to see a bear*

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/saw_with_telescope.png")
```

]

.pull-right[
**Interpretation 2**

*A girl saw a bear that had a telescope*

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/bear_with_telescope.png")
```

# A girl saw a bear with a telescope

This is an example of a **structurally ambiguous** sentence.

We can use syntax trees to visualize its two possible structures.

- In this case, these syntax trees show how there are two ways to interpret
what [*with a telescope*] modifies.

This means that *the meaning of a sentence isn't just the sum of its words:*

- **Syntactic structure also contributes to meaning.**

So let's take some time to understand these structures and how to draw them as trees.

# Types of phrases

**Syntax trees** show how words are combined into **constituents** and how constituents are related.

Another name for constituents is **phrases**, and we'll be talking about the following phrase types:

Each phrase type has a **head word** and is named after that head word's part of speech, and each phrase contains that head word *and all the words that modify that head word:*

- **NP – noun phrase** (*man, the man, the happy man, the man with the hat*)

- **PP – prepositional phrase** (*into the forest, by the author, for good luck*)

- **AdjP – adjective phrase** (*happy, extremely angry*)

- **AdvP – adverb phrase** (*quickly, very quickly*)

- **VP – verb phrase** (*eats, eats pizza, eats quickly, eats pizza quickly at noon*)

- **TP – tense phrase** or ***sentence*** (*John eats pizza quickly. I saw a dog by the tree.*)

# Noun phrases (NP)

# NPs

A noun phrase consists of a noun and all the words that modify it.

The simplest NP is a single noun:

- Harriet, dogs, soup, snow

A NP can also include any of the following:

- A determiner: the hat, my shoes, this idea, which tree

- One or more adjective phrases (AdjP): blue sky, a great time, big red trucks

  - Note: an adjective will always go in a separate AdjP, for reasons we'll discuss later.

- One or more prepositional phrases (PP): spaghetti with meatballs, trees in the yard, the tall bridge over the river

# Phrase structure rules (NPs)

We use phrase structure rules (PSRs) to specify what elements a phrase can contain.

PSRs have the following format:

--

.pull-left[
- XP → X Y Z
]

.pull-right[
phrase type X is composed of elements X, Y, Z, in that order
]

--

We can write a PSR to account for each type of NP we've seen so far

.pull-left[

- *dog* (simple noun)

- *the dog* (determiner-noun)

- *friendly dog* (adjective-noun)

- *dog in the park* (noun-PP)

- *the friendly dog in the park* (determiner-adj-noun-PP)

]

.pull-right[

NP → N

NP → D N

NP → AdjP N

NP → N PP

NP → D AdjP N PP

]

---

# Phrase structure rules (NPs)

We can combine all of these NP rules into one rule:

- **NP → (D) (AdjP+) N (PP+)**

--

**Notes**

- order matters - elements always appear in the order given in the rule

- parentheses = optional 

- no parentheses = required 

- + = one or more allowed

--

So this rule means that an NP consists of:

- optional determiner, one or more optional adjective phrase(s), noun, one or more optional prepositional phrase(s) – *in that order*
