# Review


So far we’ve seen four types of phrase, and a PSR to generate each one:

- **NP → (D) (AdjP+) N (PP+)**

- **AdjP → (AdvP) Adj**

- **AdvP → (AdvP) Adv**

- **PP → P NP**

And these correspond to constituents!

--

**Let's review with an example:**

1. *a weird rat with curly fur*

# Verb phrases and Tense phrases

---

# Verb phrase (VP)

A **verb phrase (VP)** contains a verb and everything that modifies it – generally, everything in a sentence **except** the subject (the entity that performs the action indicated by the verb).

--

- The most basic VP is a single verb:

.pull-left[

- *Peter <u>ate</u>.*

- *Sonia <u>left</u>.*
]

.pull-right[

VP → V

VP → V
]

---

# Verb phrase - Objects

Besides the verb, VPs also contain any objects of the verb.

--

- **Direct object (DO)** – person or entity affected by the action indicated by the verb. Direct objects are NPs:

  - Peter baked **[a cake]**.
  
--

- <span style="color:blue">Indirect object (IO)</span> – person or entity that receives something or benefits from the action. 

- Indirect objects can be PPs or NPs:

  - Peter baked **[a cake]** <span style="color:blue">[for his mother]</span>

  - Peter baked <span style="color:blue">[his mother]</span> **[a cake]**

--

To account for objects, let's update our VP rule:

- **VP → V (NP) (NP/PP)**

---

# Verb phrase - adjuncts

In addition to objects, a VP can contain adjuncts – optional elements that describe the action and therefore modify the verb.

--

- **Adjuncts** may be **PPs** or **AdvPs**:

.pull-left[

  - The train arrived **[at 3pm]**
  
  - The train arrived **[quickly]**
]

.pull-right[

VP → V **PP**

VP → V **AdvP**
]

---

# Verb phrase - adjuncts 

.pull-left[

A sentence can have multiple adjuncts:

- The train arrived **[quickly] [at 3:00]** 

And AdvP adjuncts can go in many places in the VP:

- Before the verb: Dave **[quickly]** jumped into his car

- Before a PP: Dave jumped **[quickly]** into his car

- At end of VP: Dave jumped into his car **[quickly]**. 

]

.pull-right[

.

VP → V **AdvP PP**

.

VP → **AdvP** V PP

VP → V **AdvP** PP

VP → V PP **AdvP**

]

--

So we have to revise our rule to allow adjuncts:

- **VP → (AdvP+) V (NP) (NP) (AdvP+) (PP+) (AdvP+)**

---

# General PSR for VPs

This general rule for a VP looks messy because they can contain so many things:

- **VP → (AdvP+) V (NP) (NP) (AdvP+) (PP+) (AdvP+)**

--

But just remember a few things:

- A **VP always has a verb head**

--

- A VP can contain many optional things like NP, PP, and AdvP arguments and adjuncts, **BUT:**

--

  - VPs do not contain the subject of the verb.

--

  - VPs will not directly contain an AdjP (since AdjPs describe nouns, not verbs).

--

  - Any NPs or PPs will always go after the verb.

--

  - Objects (NP/PP) and adjuncts (PP/AdvP) will always be siblings of the verb.

# Sentences (TPs)




---

# Tense phrases (TP) - sentences

**Sentences** are also known as **tense phrases** (**TP**, or occasionally S). 

--

They consist of:

- **NP** – a required subject

--

- **(T)** – an optional slot called "tense" that can be filled by:

--

  - modal verbs (*can, might, should...*)

--

  - auxiliary verbs (*is, are, has, will...*)

--

  - the infinitive marker *to* as in *to go, to see*

--

- **VP** – a required verb phrase (sometimes called the **predicate**)

--

General PSR for sentences: **TP → NP (T) VP**

---

# Reminders for drawing trees

- Write the sentence at the bottom of the page – leave yourself plenty of room

--

- Label the part of speech of each word.

--

- Sentences have a subject NP and predicate VP – try to identify these first, and draw the subject.

--

- Trees should follow PSRs, so try to identify elements that can be part of rules for different phrases.

--

- Every noun, adj, adv, prep has its own corresponding NP, AdjP, AdvP, PP – identify these smaller trees first, then figure out how they connect to the rest of the tree.

--

- VPs can have lots of elements, so figure them out last.

--

- Pay attention to what modifies what – any phrase that modifies a word should be its sibling.

--

- Because of the way English is structured, it can often be easier to start at the end and work backwards.

# Key takeaways

- Syntactic structure contributes to the meaning of sentences.

--

- It explains how the words in a sentence relate to each other.

--

- We use phrase structure rules to account for what types of phrases a language allows, what elements are allowed in those phrases, and in what order they occur.

--

- We use syntax trees to visualize sentence structure.

--

- Syntax trees are drawn based on phrase structure rules, so the two are connected.

# Complex sentences

# Simple and complex sentences

.pull-left[

So far we've been studying **simple sentences:** sentences with one subject NP and one predicate VP.

Now we're going to talk about **complex sentences:** sentences that have another sentence (clause) embedded inside of them.

- She said [that **she went to China**].

- I bought an umbrella [because **it was raining**].

- That's the movie [**I saw**].

- The book [that **I read**] was very interesting.

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="70%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/complex_went_to_china.png")
```
]

---

# Complex sentences 

.pull-left[

We can distinguish two parts of a complex sentence, though the terminology varies widely between textbooks.

- **Dependent clause** (aka subordinate clause, embedded clause, embedded sentence) – the sentence that has been inserted into the larger sentence

  - She said [that **she went to China**].
  
- *Main clause* (aka independent clause, main sentence) – the full sentence, technically including the dependent clause, since the dependent clause is inside of the main clause

  - *She said [that she went to China].*

]



.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="70%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/complex_went_to_china.png")
```
]

---

# Complementizers 

Dependent clauses are usually linked to main clauses with a special type of word called a **complementizer** or **subordinating conjunction** (relative pronouns are a subtype):

- *that, which, because, if, so, since, which, who, although, where...*

- She said [**that** she went to China].

- I bought an umbrella [**because** it was raining].

- Please tell me [**if** you're going to the store].

Sometimes the complementizer is omitted (often in English, *that* can be variably omitted):

- She said [**(that)** she went to China].

- The book [**(that)** I read] is about dinosaurs.

- Ben thought [**(that)** he was going to be late].

---

# Structure of dependent clauses 

.pull-left[

Since dependent clauses are **embedded sentences** with their own subject NP and predicate VP, we will consider them **TP**: TP → NP (T) VP

Dependent clause TPs are then inserted into a larger constituent called the **complementizer phrase** or **CP**: CP → (C) TP

- C for the complementizer, which is optional (we'll include a CP level even if there's no explicit complementizer for structural reasons)

And the CP is then inserted into the **main clause**.

Note that some dependent clauses don't have an explicit subject NP. You can simply omit the subject slot when writing these:

- I know the author [who **Ø wrote this book**].

- He wants [**Ø to go to Machu Picchu**].

]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="60%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/dependent_clauses.png")
```
]

# CPs inside VPs

.pull-left[

There are three roles CPs can play in a sentence.

A CP can take the role of an NP, often acting as the object of a verb (sometimes called a noun clause):

- Paula [asked [a question]NP]VP. → Paula [asked [where I went]CP]VP.

A CP can take the role of AdvP, often acting as an adjunct to a verb (sometimes called an adverbial clause):

- I was [running]VP. → I was [running [because I missed the bus]CP]VP.

Let's modify our VP rule to account for these two cases:

- VP → (AdvP+) V (NP) (NP/CP) (AdvP+) (PP+) (AdvP+) (CP+)

]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="60%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/CP_in_VP.png")
```
]

---

# CPs inside NPs

.pull-left[

A CP can act as an AdjP, modifying a noun and going inside an NP (sometimes called an adjectival clause or relative clause):

- [The girl]NP studies linguistics → [The girl [that I met]CP]NP studies linguistics

These can go inside an NP anywhere in the sentence:

- [The book [I read]] is about geology.

- She bought [the book [I read]].

Since these CPs go inside NPs, let's modify our NP rule:

- NP → (D) (AdjP+) N (PP+) (CP+)

]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="70%", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/CP_in_NP.png")
```

# Reminders for drawing complex sentences

If a sentence has two main verbs joined by a complementizer, it's complex.

--

- Note that this doesn't include sentences with two main verbs joined by a coordinating conjunction like and, or, but: I read a book and I took a walk.

--

Identify which of these verbs is in the main clause, and which is in the subordinate clause.

--

- The subordinate clause is the one that starts with a complementizer.

--

- But be aware that the complementizer that is sometimes omitted.

--

Draw the tree for the subordinate clause first.

--

Draw the tree for the main clause without the subordinate clause.

--

- Then figure out how the two are connected.

--

- Does the subordinate clause modify a noun, or is it part of the main clause's VP?
