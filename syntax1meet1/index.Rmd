# So far...

---

# So far, we've studied...

1. **Fundamental concepts in linguistics:** mental grammar, prescriptivism vs. descriptivism, standard vs. non-standard language, grammaticality 

--

2. **Morphology:** the study of the structure of words- morphemes, morphological processes, morphological analysis, hierarchical structure

--

### Now, we're moving on to **syntax!**

**syntax:** the study of the structure of sentences; how sentences are built up out of words

--

First we'll start with something we've already mentioned several times...

- **parts of speech:** nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs...

---

# Parts of speech

# Parts of speech 

**Parts of speech** (aka **lexical classes**) are categories we use to classify words

- nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs...

--

They were important in the **morphology** unit

- derivational morphology can change a word's *part of speech* 

- inflectional morphology is specific to a *part of speech*: nouns, verbs, and adjectives all inflect differently

--

They will also be important for syntax! 

- sentences are made of words

- a word's *part of speech* determines its role in a sentence

--

  - the subject of a sentence is always a **noun**, every sentence needs a main **verb**...

---

# Parts of speech

What are the parts of speech? 

How do we identify a word's part of speech? 

**Try to define the following:**

.pull-left[

- noun

- verb

- adjective

]

--

.pull-right[

- denotes a person, place, thing

- denotes actions

- adds a description to a noun

]

--

We can provide definitions of these categories

- but, these definitions rely on us **already knowing** the meaning of the word.

  - we know *table* is a noun because we know it refers to a thing

--

- can we figure out a word's part of speech **without knowing what it means?** Just by seeing how it's used in a sentence?

# Exercise (Jabberwocky)

---

# Jabberwocky

.pull-left[

- let's use Lewis Carroll's 1871 poem "Jabberwocky" to figure out another way of considering parts of speech 

- the words are nonsense, but the syntax is still English

- so, we can't rely on what we know about the words, we have to rely on how they're being used!

1. **Guess what the part of speech is for each underlined word**

2. **Be prepared to justify your answer**

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/jabberwocky.png")
```

]

---

# Jabberwocky

.pull-left[

There are two main strategies for figuring out a words part of speech based on its usage

- we can consider the word's **syntactic distribution**

- we can consider the words **morphological distribution**

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/jabberwocky.png")
```

]

# Distribution

---

# Syntactic distribution 

.pull-left[

**Syntactic distribution...**

- Where does the word appear in the sentence?

- What other words appear around it?

Consider the word *borogoves*

- it comes after *the*

- what other words can follow *the*? NOUNS!

- we conclude that *borogoves* is also a noun 

Because it fits the **syntactic distribution** of nouns- it goes where nouns go in the sentence!

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/jabberwocky.png")
```
]

---

# Morphological distribution

.pull-left[

**Morphological distribution**

- What morphemes does it have? 

- Are they associated with a specific part of speech?

Consider *borogoves* again

- it seems to end in the plural suffix *-s*

- what other words use plural *-s*? NOUNS!

- again, we conclude that *borogoves* is a noun 

Because it fits the **morphological distribution** of nouns- it uses morphemes associated with nouns

]

# Part of speech

Parts of speech aren't just random categories you have to memorize in English class

Words of a particular part of speech tend to behave in similar ways:

- They have a similar **morphological distribution** (similar morphemes),

- and a similar **syntactic distribution** (similar role in sentences).

--

That is, they follow a pattern – a pattern that forms part of our mental grammar.

- We pick up these patterns as children acquiring our native language.

- A small child might not know what a noun is, but they might know you can say *take ball, take toy, take teddy, take blankie*... but not **take eat*.

- So categories like noun and verb are part of our mental grammar, even before we learn about them explicitly in an English class.

---

# Parts of speech 

Since these categories are part of our mental grammar, they give us intuitions about how a word can or cannot be used in a sentence.

And we can use these intuitions in a **replacement test** to figure out a word's part of speech:

- Think of a sentence where you know each word's part of speech:

  - *John ate a delicious sandwich.*

- Take a word you don't know and use it to replace one of the words in your sentence.

- If sounds like a well-formed sentence, it probably has the same part of speech!

- If not, move on to the next word and try replacing that instead.

---

# Parts of speech 

Let's go through the following parts of speech one by one:

- noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, preposition, conjunction

--

For each one:

- We'll provide a **definition**

- We'll talk about its **morphological distribution** – what morphemes it can have

- We'll talk about its **syntactic distribution** – where it appears in a sentence

--

Note that these distributions can vary from language to language:

- English: *intelligent student* vs. Spanish: *estudiante inteligente*

--

But in each language, each part of speech has its own morphological and syntactic distribution

---

class: center, middle

# Nouns

---

# Nouns

How can we define a noun?

.pull-left[

- Nouns denote a person, place, or thing...

- but also abstract entities, concepts, and even actions

]

.pull-right[

*student, school, desk*

*hope, idea, year, math, fishing*

]

--

What kinds of nouns are there?

--

We can distinguish between:

.pull-left[

- common nouns

- proper nouns (names)

]

.pull-right[

*girl, river, college*

*Mary, Raritan, Rutgers*

]

---

# Nouns 

**Morphological distribution** - what suffixes can a noun have in English?

.pull-left[

- Nouns can take plural *-s* or possessive *-'s* 

- Derivational morphemes that form nouns: *-tion/-sion, -ness, -ity, -itude, -ing, -ment*...

]

.pull-right[

*cats, dogs, Mary's, students'*

*instruction, happiness, sincerity, ineptitude, reading, encouragement*

]

--

**Syntactic distribution** - where do nouns appear in sentences in English?

.pull-left[

- nouns can follow determiners like *a, the, my*...

- nouns can follow adjectives

- nouns can follow prepositions 

- nouns can be subjects of sentences 

- nouns can be objects of sentences

]

.pull-right[

*a dog, the cat, my friend*

*friendly dog, angry cat, best friend*

*at school, in line, on demand*

*Dogs are humans' best friend*

*I saw a dog*

]

---

# Pronouns 

.pull-left[
A **pronoun** takes the place of a noun

]

.pull-right[

*Mary had a little lamb = She had it.*

]

--

Some linguists consider pronouns to be a **subcategory of nouns** because they behave similarly in many ways

.pull-left[

- they can be subjects

- they can be objects
]

.pull-right[

*Dolly sings = She sings*

*Did you help your mom? = Did you help her?*

]

--

Some linguists consider pronouns a **separate part of speech** because in some ways, they behave differently

.pull-left[

- they (usually) aren't modified by *the* or an adjective

]

.pull-right[

- *the happy student*

- **the them* or **happy them*

- but, *lucky you!*
]

- in this class, we consider them a **subcategory of nouns**

---

class: center, middle

# Verbs

---

# Verbs

How do we define a verb?

.pull-left[
- verbs are "action words"

- verbs can also denote **states**

- or **processes** that aren't really *actions*

- nouns can denote actions too, so we can't *just* rely on definitions!
]

.pull-right[

*sit, jump, fly*

*be, have, know, agree, want*

*dream, feel, rest*

*a flying leap*
]

---

# Verbs 

**Morphological distribution** - what kind of morphemes can English verbs have?

.pull-left[
- verbs can be conjugated for tense and subject

- derivational morphemes that make verbs: *-ize, -ify, -ate, -en*
]

.pull-right[

*I do, she does, we did, we have done*

*modernize, electrify, validate, hasten*
]

--

**Syntactic distribution** - where do verbs go in English sentences? 

.pull-left[
- verbs go after the subject and before the object(s)

- all sentences have at least one verb 

- some sentences have **auxiliary verbs** in addition to the main verb 

- **modal verbs** are a type of auxiliary verb that expresses obligation, possibility, etc.

]

.pull-right[

*She knows me, I did it*

*I like pizza. I want an ice cream*

*I am singing. I have finished. I don't know. I am going to rest.*

*can, could, may, might, shall, should, would, must, ought to*
]

# Adjectives and adverbs 

---

# Adjectives and adverbs 

How can we define **adjectives** and **adverbs**?

--

**Adjectives** and **adverbs** modify other words, providing additional description

.pull-left[

- **adjectives** modify **nouns**

- **adverbs** modify **verbs**, **adjectives**, and other **adverbs**
]

.pull-right[

*ferocious lion*

*The cat hissed angrily. It was extremely loud. It hissed very loudly.*
]

--

**Syntactic distribution**

.pull-left[
- they generally go before the word they modify

- but adverbs can go before or after verbs
]

.pull-right[
*playful kitten, very small*

*I quickly stopped. I stopped quickly.*

]

---

# Adjectives and adverbs 

**Morphological distribution**

.pull-left[

- many English adjectives can inflect for comparative and superlative with *-er* and *-est*

- but not all!

- derivational morphemes for adjectives: *-ic, -ish, -al, -ous, -ive, -y, -ile, -like*

- derivational morphemes for adverbs: *-ly*

- though not all adverbs end in *-ly*

- some adjectives end in *-ly* too!
]

.pull-right[
*nicer, nicest, meaner, meanest*

**frigider*, **frigidest*

*bookish, scandalous, horrific, active, sloppy*

*happily, slowly*

*My cat meows loud when he is very hungry.*

*the friendly cat*

# Determiners, prepositions and conjunctions 

---

# Determiners, prepositions and conjunctions

These three are less well-known and harder to define

**Discuss:**

1. What do you remember from the reading or previous knowledge about **determiners, prepositions,** and **conjunctions**?

2. What are some examples of words in each of these categories?

**Note**

- Note: *determiner* includes *articles, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, interrogatives,* and *quantifiers* – you may not have heard the term *determiner* in previous coursework, but you may have heard of some of these subcategories.

---

# Determiners

**Determiners** gather together many words you may have learned as separate categories:

.pull-left[
- articles

- possessive pronouns

- demonstratives

- interrogative determiners

- quantifiers
]

.pull-right[

*the, a*

*my, our, your, his, her, their, its*

*this apple, that barn*

*which computer, what floor*

*all, some, many*
]

--

Determiners help specify a word's **reference:** what actual thing in the world a word refers to

- *this chalk, that chalk, my dog, not her dog, all cats, not some cats*

---

# Determiners

**Morphological distribution:**

- English determiners don't have any specific morphemes that are typical of them – in fact, they tend to be monomorphemic

**Syntactic distribution:**

.pull-left[
- determiners can go before a noun

- or before an adjective, then a noun

- English usually doesn't allow two determiners in a row
]

.pull-right[
*the apple, my cat*

*the red apple, my fluffy cat*

**the my friend*

]

---

# Prepositions 

**Prepositions** indicate some relationship between a noun and the other words in a sentence: 

- *in, on, to, by, for, from, over, under, above, below, with, without*

- Often a spatial relationship, but also grammatical relationships, conceptual relationships

--

**Morphological distribution**

- Like determiners, prepositions don't have specific suffixes and are often monomorphemic.

--

**Syntactic distribution**

.pull-left[
- prepositions go before nouns (*pre*-position)

- there can be intervening determiners and adjectives
]

.pull-right[
*on topic, in time, with cheese*

*in an hour, without melted cheese*
]

---

# Conjunctions

**Conjunctions** join together two words, phrases, or clauses

- *and, or, but, because, if, since*

--

**Coordinating conjunctions** (*and, or, but*) join two words/phrases of the same type

- *cats and dogs, come and go, I ate an apple and I read a book.*

- **Syntactic distribution:** between the two elements being joined

--

**Subordinating conjunctions** (aka **complementizers**) are used to insert one sentence (subordinate clause) into another sentence (main clause)

- *because, that, if, since, whether*...

- *I went to bed because I was tired. If you study, you will succeed.*

- **syntactic distribution:** before the subordinate clause being inserted

***add color???***

# Open and closed classes

---

# Open and closed classes

We can divide the parts of speech into **open** and **closed classes**.

--

**Open class** words have more of a *lexical meaning* – typical dictionary definition. It's fairly easy to borrow or coin new words in these categories.

- This includes nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs

--

**Closed class** words have more of a *grammatical meaning*. It's less common, but not impossible, to borrow or coin new words in these categories.

- This includes determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions

---

# Summary 

---

# Summary 

**Parts of speech** are categories of words that tend to behave in similar ways:

- noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, preposition, conjunction

We often learn them in school by **definition**.

But we can also figure them out based on context, by considering their:

- **morphological distribution** – what kinds of morphemes they have.

- **syntactic distribution** – where they tend to appear in the sentence.

By examining their distribution, we can notice patterns in the way certain types of words behave.

And this will be fundamental to our understanding of **syntax**, as we start putting words together to form **sentences**.

# Constituents!

---

# Constituents 

## What is a constituent? 

- ***A group of words that acts together as a unit***

- a basic structure in syntax

--

Some examples

- **Justin** teaches linguistics.

- **My cat** likes rice.

- **That tall guy from NJ** likes philosophy.

--

Even though the bold constituents can have only one word or several, they act as a unit to describe a single concept.

---

# Constituents: phrases (types)

**Phrases** are types of constituents 

--

Each phrase has a main word (or **head**), and phrases are named after the head word's part of speech.

---

# Constituents: phrases

- Noun phrase (NP)
  
  - *woman, the woman, the happy woman, the woman with the hat*
  
- Prepositional phrase (PP)

  - *into the forest, by the author, for good luck*

- Verb phrase (VP)

  - *eats, eats pizza, eats quickly, eats pizza quickly at midnight*
  
- Adjective phrase (AdjP)

  - *happy*
  
- Adverb phrase (AdvP)

  - *quickly*

**Note that one constituent may contain another, smaller constituent.**

---

class: center, middle

# Constituency tests!

---

# Constituency tests 
We can do tests to determine whether a group of words form a constituent or not.

These are the four tests we'll use:

--

1. replacement/substitution 

2. stand-alone

3. movement 

4. coordination 

**As is usually the case, these tests don't always work 100% of the time, so you should try multiple!!!**

---

# Constituency tests 

Consider the following sentence ([the happy student] and [in New Brunswick] are constituents)

- [The happy student] lives [in New Brunswick]

This is the example sentence which we will perform constituency tests for.

---

# Constituency tests

## Replacement


**Replacement test:** try replacing a group of words with a *pro-form* (a pronoun or another generic expression such as *there, like that, do, do that, that way*).

If it works, or still sounds grammatical, then the words are a constituent.

--

- [The happy student] lives in New Brunswick → [She] lives in New Brunswick
  
  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent!

--

- The happy student [lives in New] Brunswick → The happy student [??] Brunswick

  - this **doesn't** work, so [lives in New] is not a constituent 


---

# Constituency tests 

## Stand alone

**Stand alone test:** try coming up with a question that can be answered by just saying the group of words you want to test on its own

- Who lives in New Brunswick? [The happy student]!

  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent


---

# Constituency tests  

## Movement 

**Movement test:** try moving a group of words to a different part of the sentence, like the beginning or end of the sentence. You *may* need to add extra words to support this movement.

- The person who lives in New Brunswick is [the happy student].

  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent
  
- Student who lives in New Brunswick is [the happy]

  - this doesn't work, so [the happy] is not a constituent


---

# Constituency tests 

## Coordination 

**Coordination test:** coordinating conjunctions like *and* or *or* will always join two words or phrases of the same type. So, if a group of words is a constituent, you should be able to insert another phrase of the same type joined with *and* or *or*

- [The happy student] and [the grumpy professor] live in New Brunswick.

  - this works, so [the happy student] is a constituent
