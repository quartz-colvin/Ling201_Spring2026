# So far, we've studied...

# So far, we've studied...

1. **Fundamental concepts in linguistics:** mental grammar, prescriptivism vs. descriptivism, standard vs. non-standard language, grammaticality 

--

2. **Morphology:** the study of the structure of words- morphemes, morphological processes, morphological analysis, hierarchical structure

--

### Now, we're moving on to **syntax!**

**Syntax:** the study of the structure of sentences; how sentences are built up out of words

--

First, we'll start with something we've already mentioned several times...

- **parts of speech:** nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs...

---

# Parts of speech 

**Parts of speech** (aka **lexical classes**) are categories we use to classify words

- nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs...

--

They were important in the **morphology** unit

--

- derivational morphology can change a word's *part of speech* 

- inflectional morphology is specific to a *part of speech*: nouns, verbs, and adjectives all inflect differently

--

They will also be important for syntax! 

- sentences are made of words

- a word's *part of speech* determines its role in a sentence

--

  - the subject of a sentence is always a **noun**, every sentence needs a main **verb**...

---

# Parts of speech

What are the parts of speech? 

How do we identify a word's part of speech? 

--

**Try to define the following:**

.pull-left[

- noun

- verb

- adjective

]

--

.pull-right[

- denotes a person, place, thing

- denotes actions

- adds a description to a noun

]

--

We can provide definitions of these categories

- but, these definitions rely on us **already knowing** the meaning of the word.

  - we know *table* is a noun because we know it refers to a thing

--

- can we figure out a word's part of speech **without knowing what it means?** Just by seeing how it's used in a sentence?

# Exercise (Jabberwocky)

---

# Jabberwocky

.pull-left[

- let's use Lewis Carroll's 1871 poem "Jabberwocky" to figure out another way of considering parts of speech 

- the words are nonsense, but the syntax is still English

- so, we can't rely on what we know about the words, we have to rely on how they're being used!

1. **Guess what the part of speech is for each underlined word**

2. **Be prepared to justify your answer**

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/jabberwocky.png")
```

]

---

# Jabberwocky

.pull-left[

There are two main strategies for figuring out a words part of speech based on its usage

- we can consider the word's **syntactic distribution**

- we can consider the words **morphological distribution**

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/jabberwocky.png")
```

]

# Syntactic & morphological distribution

---

# Syntactic distribution 

.pull-left[

**Syntactic distribution...**

- Where does the word appear in the sentence?

- What other words appear around it?

Consider the word *borogoves*

- it comes after *the*

- what other words can follow *the*? <u>NOUNS</u>!

- we conclude that *borogoves* is also a noun 

Because it fits the **syntactic distribution** of nouns- it goes where nouns go in the sentence!

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/jabberwocky.png")
```
]

---

# Morphological distribution

.pull-left[

**Morphological distribution**

- What morphemes does it have? 

- Are they associated with a specific part of speech?

Consider *borogoves* again

- it seems to end in the plural suffix *-s*

- what other words use plural *-s*? <u>NOUNS</u>!

- again, we conclude that *borogoves* is a noun 

Because it fits the **morphological distribution** of nouns- it uses morphemes associated with nouns

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="auto", out.height="auto", echo=FALSE}

# Back to parts of speech

# Part of speech

Parts of speech aren't just random categories you have to memorize in English class

--

Words of a particular part of speech tend to behave in similar ways:

- They have a similar **morphological distribution** (similar morphemes),

- and a similar **syntactic distribution** (similar role in sentences).

--

That is, they follow a pattern – a pattern that forms part of our mental grammar.

- We pick up these patterns as children acquiring our native language.

--

- A small child might not know what a noun is, but they might know you can say *take ball, take toy, take teddy, take blankie*... but not **take eat*.

- So categories like noun and verb are part of our mental grammar, even before we learn about them explicitly in an English class.

---

# Parts of speech 

Since these categories are part of our mental grammar, they give us intuitions about how a word can or cannot be used in a sentence.

--

And we can use these intuitions in a **replacement test** to figure out a word's part of speech:

--

- Think of a sentence where you know each word's part of speech:

  - *John ate a delicious sandwich.* (for example)

--

- Take a word you don't know and use it to replace one of the words in your sentence.

--

  - If it sounds like a well-formed sentence, it probably has the same part of speech!

  - If not, move on to the next word and try replacing that instead.

---

# Parts of speech 

Let's go through the following parts of speech one by one:

- noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, preposition, conjunction

--

For each one:

- We'll provide a **definition**

--

- We'll talk about its **morphological distribution** – what morphemes it can have

--

- We'll talk about its **syntactic distribution** – where it appears in a sentence

--

Note that these distributions can vary from language to language:

- English: *intelligent student* vs. Spanish: *estudiante inteligente*

--

But in each language, each part of speech has its own morphological and syntactic distribution

# Nouns

---

# Nouns

How can we define a noun?

--

.pull-left[

- Nouns denote a person, place, or thing...

- but also abstract entities, concepts, and even actions

]

.pull-right[

*student, school, desk*

*hope, idea, year, math, fishing*

]

--

What kinds of nouns are there?

--

We can distinguish between:

.pull-left[

- common nouns

- proper nouns (names)

]

.pull-right[

*girl, river, college*

*Mary, Raritan, Rutgers*

]

---

# Nouns 

**Morphological distribution** - what suffixes can a noun have in English?

--

.pull-left[

- Nouns can take plural *-s* or possessive *-'s* 

- Derivational morphemes that form nouns: *-tion/-sion, -ness, -ity, -itude, -ing, -ment*...

]

.pull-right[

*cats, dogs, Mary's, students'*

*instruction, happiness, sincerity, ineptitude, reading, encouragement*

]

--

**Syntactic distribution** - where do nouns appear in sentences in English?

--

.pull-left[

- nouns can follow determiners like *a, the, my*...

- nouns can follow adjectives

- nouns can follow prepositions 

- nouns can be subjects of sentences 

- nouns can be objects of sentences

]

.pull-right[

*a <u>dog</u>, the <u>cat</u>, my <u>friend</u>*

*friendly <u>dog</u>, angry <u>cat</u>, best <u>friend</u>*

*at <u>school</u>, in <u>line</u>, on <u>demand</u>*

*<u>Dogs</u> are humans' best friend*

*I saw a <u>dog</u>*

]

---

# Pronouns 

.pull-left[
A **pronoun** takes the place of a noun

]

.pull-right[

*<u>Mary</u> had <u>a little lamb</u>. = <u>She</u> had <u>it</u>.*

]

--

Some linguists consider pronouns to be a **subcategory of nouns** because they behave similarly in many ways

--

.pull-left[

- they can be subjects

- they can be objects
]

.pull-right[

*Dolly sings = <u>She</u> sings*

*Did you help your mom? = Did you help <u>her</u>?*

]

--

Some linguists consider pronouns a **separate part of speech** because in some ways, they behave differently

--

.pull-left[

- they (usually) aren't modified by *the* or an adjective

]

.pull-right[

- *the happy student*

- **the them* 

- **happy them*

- but, *lucky you!*
]

--

In this class, we consider them a **subcategory of nouns**

# Verbs

---

# Verbs

How do we define a verb?

--

.pull-left[
- verbs are "action words"

- verbs can also denote **states**

- or **processes** that aren't really *actions*

- nouns can denote actions too, so we can't *just* rely on definitions!
]

.pull-right[

*sit, jump, fly*

*be, have, know, agree, want*

*dream, feel, rest*

*a flying leap*
]

---

# Verbs 

**Morphological distribution** - what kind of morphemes can English verbs have?

--

.pull-left[
- verbs can be conjugated for tense and subject

- derivational morphemes that make verbs: *-ize, -ify, -ate, -en*
]

.pull-right[

*I do, she does, we did, we have done*

*modernize, electrify, validate, hasten*
]

--

**Syntactic distribution** - where do verbs go in English sentences? 

--

.pull-left[
- verbs go after the subject and before the object(s)

- all sentences have at least one verb 

- some sentences have **auxiliary verbs** in addition to the main verb 

- **modal verbs** are a type of auxiliary verb that expresses obligation, possibility, etc.

]

.pull-right[

*She <u>knows</u> me, I <u>did</u> it*

.

*I <u>like</u> pizza. I <u>want</u> an ice cream*

*I <u>am</u> singing. I <u>have</u> finished. I <u>don't</u> know. I <u>am</u> going to rest.*

*can, could, may, might, shall, should, would, must, ought to*

# Adjectives and adverbs 

---

# Adjectives and adverbs 

How can we define **adjectives** and **adverbs**?

--

**Adjectives** and **adverbs** modify other words, providing additional description

.pull-left[

- **adjectives** modify **nouns**

- **adverbs** modify **verbs**, **adjectives**, and other **adverbs**
]

.pull-right[

*<u>ferocious</u> lion*

*The cat hissed <u>angrily</u>. It was <u>extremely</u> loud. It hissed <u>very</u> loudly.*
]

--

**Syntactic distribution**

.pull-left[
- they generally go before the word they modify

- but adverbs can go before or after verbs
]

.pull-right[
*<u>playful</u> kitten, <u>very</u> small*

*I <u>quickly</u> stopped. I stopped <u>quickly</u>.*

]

---

# Adjectives and adverbs 

**Morphological distribution**

.pull-left[

- many English adjectives can inflect for comparative and superlative with *-er* and *-est*

- but not all!

- derivational morphemes for adjectives: *-ic, -ish, -al, -ous, -ive, -y, -ile, -like*

- derivational morphemes for adverbs: *-ly*

- though not all adverbs end in *-ly*

- some adjectives end in *-ly* too!
]

.pull-right[
*nicer, nicest, meaner, meanest*

**frigider* is bad

**frigidest*

*bookish, scandalous, horrific, active, sloppy, senile, cave-like*

*happily, slowly*

*My cat meows <u>loud</u> when he is very hungry.*

*the <u>friendly</u> cat*

# Determiners, prepositions and conjunctions 

---

# Determiners, prepositions and conjunctions

These three are less well-known and harder to define...

--

**Discuss:**

1. What do you remember from the reading or previous knowledge about **determiners, prepositions,** and **conjunctions**?

2. What are some examples of words in each of these categories?

--

**Note**

- Note: *determiner* includes *articles, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, interrogatives,* and *quantifiers* – you may not have heard the term *determiner* in previous coursework, but you may have heard of some of these subcategories.

---

# Determiners

**Determiners** gather together many words you may have learned as separate categories:

--

.pull-left[
- articles

- possessive pronouns

- demonstratives

- interrogative determiners

- quantifiers
]

.pull-right[

*the, a*

*my, our, your, his, her, their, its*

*<u>this</u> apple, <u>that</u> barn*

*<u>which</u> computer, <u>what</u> floor*

*all, some, many*
]

--

Determiners help specify a word's **reference:** what actual thing in the world a word refers to

--

- *<u>this</u> chalk, <u>that</u> chalk, <u>my</u> dog, not <u>her</u> dog, <u>all</u> cats, not <u>some</u> cats*

---

# Determiners

**Morphological distribution:**

- English determiners don't have any specific morphemes that are typical of them – in fact, they tend to be monomorphemic

--

**Syntactic distribution:**

.pull-left[
- determiners can go before a noun

- or before an adjective, then a noun

- English usually doesn't allow two determiners in a row
]

.pull-right[
*<u>the</u> apple, <u>my</u> cat*

*<u>the</u> red apple, <u>my</u> fluffy cat*

**<u>the my</u> friend*

]

---

# Prepositions 

**Prepositions** indicate some relationship between a noun and the other words in a sentence: 

--

- *in, on, to, by, for, from, over, under, above, below, with, without*

--

- Often a spatial relationship, but also grammatical relationships, conceptual relationships

--

**Morphological distribution**

- Like determiners, prepositions don't have specific suffixes and are often monomorphemic.

--

**Syntactic distribution**

.pull-left[
- prepositions go before nouns (*pre*-position)

- there can be intervening determiners and adjectives
]

.pull-right[
*<u>on</u> topic, <u>in</u> time, <u>with</u> cheese*

*<u>in</u> an hour, <u>without</u> melted cheese*
]

---

# Conjunctions

**Conjunctions** join together two words, phrases, or clauses

- *and, or, but, because, if, since*

--

**Coordinating conjunctions** (*and, or, but*) join two words/phrases of the same type

--

- *cats <u>and</u> dogs, come <u>and</u> go, I ate an apple <u>and</u> I read a book.*

--

- **Syntactic distribution:** between the two elements being joined

--

**Subordinating conjunctions** (aka **complementizers**) are used to insert one sentence (<span style="color: red;">subordinate clause</span>) into another sentence (<span style="color: blue;">main clause</span>)

- *because, that, if, since, whether*...

--

- *<span style="color: blue;">I went to bed</span> <u>because</u> <span style="color: red;">I was tired</span>.*

--

- *<u>If</u> <span style="color: red;">you study</span>, <span style="color: blue;">you will succeed</span>.*

--

- **Syntactic distribution:** before the subordinate clause being inserted

# Open and closed classes

---

# Open and closed classes

We can divide the parts of speech into **open** and **closed classes**.

--

**Open class** words have more of a *lexical meaning* – typical dictionary definition. It's fairly easy to borrow or coin new words in these categories.

--

- This includes nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs

--

**Closed class** words have more of a *grammatical meaning*. It's less common, but not impossible, to borrow or coin new words in these categories.

--

- This includes determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions

# Summary 

---

# Summary 

**Parts of speech** are categories of words that tend to behave in similar ways:

- noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, preposition, conjunction

--

We often learn them in school by **definition**.

--

But we can also figure them out based on context, by considering their:

- **morphological distribution** – what kinds of morphemes they have.

- **syntactic distribution** – where they tend to appear in the sentence.

--

By examining their distribution, we can notice patterns in the way certain types of words behave.

--

And this will be fundamental to our understanding of **syntax**, as we start putting words together to form **sentences**.
